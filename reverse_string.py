# Your Task

# Define a function called reverse_string that accepts one argument (a string).
# Return the reversed version of the string.
# Try using string slicing as a first approach.
# Bonus: After you get it working, try writing a second version using a for loop to build the reversed string manually.


def reverse_string(s):
    print(s[::-1])
